# Residential Units Price Prediction

In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict the sale listing price of residential units in different locations in Dubai.
I collected the data from bayut.com. The data includes the unit properties like area, number of bathrooms and bedrooms and location which is embedded as one-hot encoding of the locations.
After experimentation, Random Forest turned out to be the best model to fit the data with reasonable accuracy and no overfitting.

Following the link, you can find a map that shows the the average price of units in a given location given its properties.
